Classes helps to encapsulate attributes and methods. Creating a class creates a data type (class) where we can create objects of that specific type. Objects of a class can have attributes to define it’s state and methods to modify it’s state. Class inheritance allows the inheritance of attributes and methods from multiple base classes. A method in child class can overide the method in parent class. A child class can overide a method from parent class, but at the same time it can still call the method from parent class using a super() function. Python classes are mutable in nature. They are created in runtime and can be modified in runtime.
